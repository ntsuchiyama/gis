Packages used for task

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```
1. Read in global gender inequality data 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read in gender inequality data
gii<- read_csv("HDR21-22_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv")

# subset to essential info and gender inequality index in 2010 and 2019
gii_sub <- gii %>%
  select(iso3, country, gii_2010, gii_2019)
```

2. Join the global gender inequality index to spatial data of the World, creating a new column of difference in inequality

```{r}
# load in spatial data of the world
world <- read_sf("World_Countries_(Generalized)/World_Countries__Generalized_.shp")

# join the gii to the world spatial data
gii_world <- world %>%
  left_join(., gii_sub, by = c('ISO' = 'iso3'))

# make column for difference in gii in 2010 and 2019
gii_sub <- gii_sub %>%
  mutate(gii_dif = gii_2019 - gii_2010)
```

3. Share it with the World on GitHub

4. Add you repository URL to the circulated spreadsheet
